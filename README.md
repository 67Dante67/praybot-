# Multiserver Auto Bump Bot

Bump all your servers automatically. It will send bump messages to each server with a 20 min intreval between each bump.
This bot is written in python using discord.py-self library.

**Note: Using this bot for more than 4 servers might cause some problems**

- How to configure it?

First download the repo. Then go to the main.py file and replace `TOKEN` with your account token, then put your channel IDs in the `CHANNEL_IDS`. Finally change the `LOG_CHANNEL` with your log channel ID the bot will send the bump logs in that channel.

**Make sure you have python and discord.py-self installed if you want to do test run. But discord.py-self might break your regular discord.py lib**

- How to host it?

There is no trusted site that hosts self-bots. But you can use replit and uptime robot but it will not stay online always you will need to monitor it. You can use PolyNode but I don't have that much exprerience using it, so use at your own risk!

### Note: Self bots are against Discord TOS and we do not encourage you to use self bots. This project was just done for educational pourpose
